#Introduction
The health system in Nigeria is characterized by a multitude of health facilities spanning primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care. These facilities include primary health centers, dispensaries, general hospitals, maternity homes, specialist hospitals, and military or paramilitary clinics.
A dataset that provides a nationwide inventory, detailing attributes such as functional status, category, facility type, accessibility, and geographic location—down to Local Government Areas (LGAs) and wards was obtained from the HDX website. This comprehensive dataset represents a critical tool that could be useful in evaluating health infrastructure readiness across Nigeria.

Problem Statement
Despite the vast number of health facilities in Nigeria, many are either not functional or only partially functional. The ongoing insurgency and resulting displacement of populations have led to deterioration and inaccessibility of health services for many communities. The presence of numerous Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps further strains limited health resources. The lack of up-to-date information on the operational status, distribution, and types of health facilities restricts effective planning, resource allocation, and response efforts. To improve health outcomes and facilitate equitable healthcare access, there is an urgent need to systematically assess and monitor the functional condition and geographic spread of health facilities across Nigeria.

Objectives
Summarize the distribution of health facility types across regions.
Assess the operational (functional) status and of facilities across regions.
Evaluate the accessibility of  health facilities across regions.
Pinpoint facility-type imbalances.
Provide insights and recommendations for infrastructure improvement, resource allocation, and contingency planning.

Facility-Type Imbalances
Overwhelming emphasis on primary care, reflecting health policy but potentially masking gaps at secondary/tertiary levels.
Tertiary hospitals are scarce in the northern region and several states, threatening availability of specialized and referral services.
Secondary facilities are more common than tertiary but still limited relative to primary.

Recommendations
Rehabilitate non-functional and partially functional primary and secondary health facilities in conflict-affected areas.
Establish new tertiary health facilities or upgrade existing secondary centers in under-served areas.
Increase staffing, supplies, and operational support for existing primary and secondary facilities.
Deploy mobile clinics and outreach programs in unstable or inaccessible regions to address service gaps.
Develop disaster and conflict contingency plans with rapid response teams to restore or replace health services.
Strengthen community health worker roles and decentralized care to maintain basic services.
Invest in tertiary care infrastructure in northern states based on population needs and geographic coverage.
Improve referral linkages between primary, secondary, and tertiary health services to optimize patient care.
